# My study Habits Project
In my fifth semester I logged weekly every hour of studying in an Excel spreadsheet. In this project I want analyze this data=) I performed initial analysis and visualisations.

## The ***questions*** that I want to answer with my project:
1) How was my time distributed? Was it different for different subjects? What did I do hourlywise to get good grades? Does cramming help?
2) What law governs my hours in the fifth semester? How accurate is it?



## Outline of the project files:
1. data folder - folder with the data to analyze
2. img folder - folder with supplementary images for the Jupyter Notebook
3. <inc>Study Habits.ipynb</inc> - main file: Jupyter Notebook with the data exploration, analysis and visualisation


## The goal of the project was to practice:
1. exploratory analysis of the data and answering my initial questions
2. digging a level deeper and gaining insights on the influence of hours on grades and its dependecy
3. different statistic dependencies and its impact on the data interpretation
4. Object Oriented visualising style
