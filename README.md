# My study Habits Project
In this project I analyzed my logged studied hours in the fifth semester. I performed initial analysis and visualisations.

The questions that I want to answer:
1) How was my time distributed? Was it different for different subjects? What did I do hourlywise to get good grades? Does cramming help?
2) What law governs my hours in the first semester? How accurate is it?

***Thanks in advance, if you time find to read my analysis=)***
